# Project Reactor - RabbitMQ - Samples

"Reactor RabbitMQ API enables messages to be published to RabbitMQ and consumed from RabbitMQ using functional APIs with non-blocking back-pressure and very low overheads."

## Overview

This project contains pratical examples using the Reactor RabbitMQ API. It is intended to serve as a guide for spring boot developers new to the Spring Webflux. 

If you are building a new Spring application using the WebFlux functional web framework with functional endpoints you will want to use functional APIs.

"Reactor RabbitMQ is not intended to replace any of the existing Java libraries. Instead, it is aimed at providing an alternative API for reactive event-driven applications."

## Learning Objectives

* Implement Reactor RabbitMQ API in your application.
* Setup and configuration for the Sender and Receiver applications.
* Understand basics concepts of message queues.
* Implement a real world use case (Sample 2)

## Sample 1
In this first sample, we will learn how we can send a simple message to the queue and how the consumer can consume those values using the  functional API.

## Sample 2
This sample is based on a use case with a order service and a database manager. 

The main objective of the sample is to learn about using Reactive RabbitMQ with a more concrete example, with that in mind I have decide not to implement any database (please feel free to complete the project if you feel like it).
